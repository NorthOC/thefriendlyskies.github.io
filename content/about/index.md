## Who are you?

I call myself an aviation enthusiast, who loves travelling and exploring various types of aircrafts for fun. I am not a pilot myself, nor I work in the aviation industry, however I spent countless hours watching crash investigations, take offs, landings and air travel in general. Over 10 years, I have collected a lot of knowledge in my head. Finally, I have decided to share my knowledge with anyone who is interested in aviation. 

## What is this page about?

This website is about civil aviation, military aviation, technical aspects of aircraft design, aerospace, my personal experiences with aviation and many more topics concerned with… yes, you guessed it, aviation!

## Boeing or Airbus?

Airbus and no this isn’t only because of Boeing 737 MAX safety issues. I don’t change football teams just because my team is losing, but Airbus has never lost to me hehe. Since I started flying as a passenger (my first flight was at 5 years old), I quickly could distinguish between aircraft types just by listening to the engine sound. This was my first butterfly moment when I sat in an A320 and heard the CFM56-5B. I could list a lot of reasons why my heart leans towards Airbus. I promise, I will write an article with all of the characteristics.
