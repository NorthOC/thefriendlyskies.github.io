## What is this page about?

This blog is about civil aviation, technical aspects of aircraft design, aerospace, my personal experiences with aviation and many more topics concerned with … yes, you guessed it, aviation!

## Who are you?

I call myself an aviation enthusiast, who loves travelling and exploring various types of aircrafts for fun. I am not a pilot myself, nor I work in the aviation industry, however I spent countless hours watching crash investigations, take offs, landings and air travel in general. Over 10 years, I have collected a lot of knowledge in my head. Finally, I have decided to share my knowledge with anyone who is interested in aviation. 

## Can I comment on your articles?

Sure, I would love to discuss my articles with fellow aviation enthusiasts and even receive some objective criticism. I upload each article to a Telegram page, which you can join too here: [https://t.me/tfskies](https://t.me/tfskies)

## Boeing or Airbus?

Airbus and no this isn’t only because of Boeing 737 MAX safety issues. I don’t change football teams just because my team is losing, but Airbus has never lost to me hehe. Since I started flying as a passenger (my first flight was at 5 years old), I quickly could distinguish between aircraft types just by listening to the engine sound. This was my first butterfly moment when I sat in an A320 and heard the CFM56-5B. I could list a lot of reasons why my heart leans towards Airbus. I promise, I will write an article with all of the characteristics.
