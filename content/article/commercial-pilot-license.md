Are you dreaming of flying airplanes and becoming a commercial pilot? If so, you're not alone. Many individuals who are passionate about aviation aspire to become pilots, but it can be challenging to figure out how to get started. 

In this guide, I will walk you through the necessary steps to become a commercial pilot, including how long it takes, the requirements, and some tips to help you achieve your dream.

## Understanding the Commercial Pilot Requirements

To become a commercial pilot, there are specific requirements you must meet. They include:

### Step 1: Legal Requirements 

In Europe, you [must be at least 18 years](https://goldenepaulettes.com/commercial-pilot-qualifications-europe) old to become a commercial pilot and have at least a high school diploma or equivalent.

### Step 2: Obtaining a Private Pilot's License (PPL)

To become a commercial pilot, you must first obtain a PPL. A PPL allows you to fly single-engine aircraft during daylight hours under visual flight rules. You can obtain a PPL by completing a [minimum of 45 hours of flight training](https://www.flyeptspain.com/easa-ppl-a-course) with a certified flight instructor (CFI).

### Step 3: Obtaining an Instrument Rating (IR)

After obtaining a PPL, you must obtain an IR. An IR allows you to fly in conditions where the visibility is poor or at night. To obtain an IR, you must complete a minimum of 50 hours of cross-country flight time, including [40 hours of simulated or actual instrument flight time](https://www.aopa.org/training-and-safety/active-pilots/ratings-and-endorsements/instrument-rating).

### Step 4: Obtaining a Commercial Pilot's License (CPL)

After obtaining an IR, you must obtain a CPL. A CPL allows you to fly for commercial purposes, such as conducting tours, aerial photography, or operating as a flight instructor. To obtain a CPL, you must complete a [minimum of 200 hours of flight time](https://www.atpl.at/CPL_flight_training.php), including 100 hours of pilot-in-command time and 20 hours of cross-country flight time.

### Step 5: Building Flight Time

Once you obtain a CPL, you need to build flight time to qualify for most commercial pilot positions. You can build flight time by working as a flight instructor, conducting aerial tours, or doing any other job that allows you to log hours.

### Step 6: Obtaining Additional Certifications and Ratings

As a commercial pilot, you may need to obtain additional certifications and ratings, depending on the type of aircraft you plan to fly. For example, you may need a multi-engine rating to fly aircraft with multiple engines or a type rating to fly specific types of aircraft. You must also obtain a medical certificate from an approved aviation medical examiner.

## How Long Does it Take to Become a Commercial Pilot?

The length of time it takes to become a commercial pilot depends on several factors, including your availability, financial resources, and the flight school you attend. 

On average, it takes about 18-24 months to complete all the necessary training and obtain a CPL. However, some students may take longer to complete the training if they have limited availability or need to take breaks due to financial or personal reasons.

## To sum up

Becoming a commercial pilot requires dedication, hard work, and a significant investment of time and money. However, for those who are passionate about flying, it can be an incredibly rewarding career. By following the steps outlined in this guide, European pilots can start their journey towards becoming commercial pilot.
