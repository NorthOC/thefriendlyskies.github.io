Private jet charter companies have transformed air travel by offering luxurious, convenient, and personalized experiences. 

With so many private jet charter options available today, finding the right one that fits your needs can be challenging. To make it easier for you, I’ve curated a list of the top 10 private jet charter companies, ranked by their popularity and fleet size.

## Honorable mentions

The aviation industry is changing rapidly. Therefore, we decided to rank only the companies for which we had the latest (2024) and specific fleet data available. This approach ensured a fair comparison between companies. Consequently, several prominent players in the field, such as Air Charter Service, Sentient Jet, Magellan Jets, Clay Lacy Aviation, Solairus Aviation and Nicholas Air, were left out of this list.

Now back to the Friendly Skies list…

## The biggest private jet charter companies

Let’s take a closer look at the Top 10 largest private jet charter companies in the world for 2024, ranked by their fleet size and popularity. We'll start with the company in 10th place and work our way up to the company with the largest fleet.

## 10. PlaneSense 

PlaneSense was established in 1996 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The company operates the Pilatus PC-12 turboprop and the PC-24 light jet aircraft, making it the [largest operator](https://www.planesense.com/largest-u-s-pilatus-fleet-operator-finds-success-in-experience-service-and-value/) of the Pilatus PC-12 in the world.

## 9. JSX (formerly JetSuiteX)

JSX operates as a public charter company and [does not directly manage its own aircraft](https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/jet-suite-to-offer-luxury-travel-between-california-and-las-vegas/). Instead, it charters regional jets from a subsidiary and resells seats to the public. JSX uses fixed-base operator (FBO) terminals, providing customers with a more private jet-like experience. As a result, JSX flights depart from private jet terminals, separate from standard passenger terminals.
