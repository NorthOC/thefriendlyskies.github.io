In times when vaping and electronic cigarettes have become increasingly popular, it's not uncommon for travelers to wonder about the rules and regulations surrounding electronic smoking devices when planning their trip abroad. Bringing vapes and e-cigarettes on a plane can be a bit of a gray area, with a multitude of factors to consider, from airline and airport policies to the laws of the country you're traveling to.

Therefore, we will explain everything you need to know when it comes to traveling with e-cigarettes and vapes, including whether to store them in your checked luggage or carry-on, potential risks, and the various policies and regulations governing these devices.

## What do you need to know when traveling with e-cigarettes and vapes?

### Battery safety

One of the first considerations when traveling with e-cigarettes and vapes is battery safety. Lithium-ion batteries are commonly used in these devices, and while they are generally safe, they can pose a risk if damaged or improperly stored. It's essential to ensure that your batteries are in good condition, stored securely to prevent short circuits, and carried in their original packaging or a protective case. 

In the United States and Europe, each lithium-ion battery should not surpass a power rating of 100 Watt-hours (Wh). Also, lithium metal batteries should contain no more than 2 grams of lithium content.

### Air pressure

E-cigarettes and vapes can be sensitive to changes in air pressure, which can occur during a flight. While it's uncommon for these devices to experience significant issues, some users have reported leaks or changes in performance. To mitigate these issues, it's a good practice to keep your device upright and take steps to prevent pressure-related mishaps.

### Liquid storage

Proper liquid storage is crucial to avoid leaks and spills. E-liquids should be stored in leak-proof containers, adhering to the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) guidelines for carrying liquids in your carry-on luggage. Remember to place your vape in a transparent bag along with your other liquid items. Also, ensure that you don't exceed the allowed liquid volume which is 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters). 

### Spare parts and accessories

When packing your e-cigarettes and vapes, remember to carry essential spare parts, such as coils, tanks, and mouthpieces, as these can be hard to find at your destination. It's also a good idea to pack a cleaning kit for maintenance.

### Cleaning and maintenance

A well-maintained vape or e-cigarette is less likely to cause issues during your journey. Regular cleaning and maintenance of your device can prevent leaks, ensure proper performance, and extend the lifespan of your equipment.

### Impact on other passengers

It's important to consider the impact your vaping may have on fellow passengers. Many travelers are sensitive to the presence of e-cigarette vapor, therefore be respectful of others and adhere to in-flight rules.

## Emptying your vape tank before flying

To prevent leaks and spills during air travel, it's highly recommended to empty your vape tank before your flight. As we have mentioned, changes in air pressure can cause e-liquids to expand and potentially leak.

Also, vaping devices can sometimes resemble prohibited items, so having an empty tank can make the security screening process smoother and avoid unnecessary delays.

## Checked vs. carry-on

### Airline policies on e-cigarettes and vapes

Smoking and vaping are universally prohibited on flights operated by airlines worldwide. While European airlines are not legally obligated to enforce smoking bans, they have voluntarily adopted no-smoking policies, making it clear that using e-cigarettes or vapes is not allowed during the journey.

Some airlines may permit passengers to carry e-cigarettes and vapes, but these devices must be stored in carry-on baggage and cannot be used or charged during the flight. 

Specific guidelines often apply, typically restricting e-liquids to 100ml per bottle and limiting the total number of batteries to 15, encompassing all devices. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) allows for 20 extra batteries of any type but must be approved by the carrier itself.

*Note: The maximum number of spare batteries allowed in your carry-on varies across different airlines. Be sure to check the rules before your flight.*

### Airport policies and security screening

At the airport, you'll need to navigate security checkpoints, where policies on carrying e-cigarettes and vapes are enforced.

At security checkpoints, your vaping device and liquids must adhere to the TSA's and EASA's rules. Be prepared for additional screening if needed. Adhere to the 3-1-1 rule for carrying liquids. This means you can carry a quart-sized bag containing containers of e-liquids up to 3.4 ounces each.

Also, be aware of the airport's list of prohibited items, as some components or accessories of e-cigarettes and vapes may fall into this category.

## Vaping and smoking requirements for the country you're traveling to

The legal age for purchasing and using vaping products can differ from one country to another. Some countries may have restrictions on importing or exporting vaping products, including e-liquids. Understanding the potential penalties for violating vaping and smoking regulations in your destination is crucial to avoid any legal issues.

*Note: Different countries have varying regulations regarding vaping and smoking, so it's important to research the laws of your destination.*

## Additional considerations

Some airports have designated lounges where you can use your e-cigarettes and vapes. Check if your departure or layover airports offer such facilities.

You may also consider purchasing travel insurance that covers the loss or damage of your vaping equipment.

And lastly, be mindful of cultural differences regarding vaping and smoking. What's acceptable in one place may not be in another, so it's essential to respect local norms.
