An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner carrying 242 people crashed into a residential area of Ahmedabad shortly after takeoff Thursday, killing at least 290 people in what is now the deadliest aviation disaster in India in over a decade.

## Air India Flight 171 Crash Details

Air India Flight 171 departed Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport at 1:38 p.m. local time en route to London Gatwick. Within five minutes, the aircraft issued a mayday call and lost altitude at just 625 feet (191 metres) before crashing into the B.J. Medical College hostel complex in the Meghani Nagar neighborhood.

Eyewitnesses described hearing multiple explosions and seeing thick black smoke rise from the crash site. A video captured the aircraft pitching upward with landing gear down before stalling and plummeting into the building. The plane burst into flames on impact. Also, the tail section was seen lodged into a building and fuselage and landing gear were found on the street.

## Aircraft and Crew

The aircraft, [registered as VT-ANB](https://flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/vt-anb), was an 11-year-old Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner powered by General Electric GEnx engines. This is the first fatal crash involving a 787 since the aircraft’s introduction in 2011.

The flight was commanded by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and First Officer Clive Kundar. On board were nationals from:

- **India:** 169
- **United Kingdom:** 53
- **Portugal:** 7
- **Canada:** 1

Among the passengers was former Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. He is believed to have passed away. 

## Emergency Response

Firefighters, paramedics, the CISF, and Indian Army personnel responded rapidly. The area was sealed off and flight operations at Ahmedabad Airport were suspended. A military hospital has been placed on standby.

## Investigation and Early Indicators

India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have launched full investigations. Initial reports indicate the crash occurred under clear weather conditions. The aircraft “began to plunge at 475 feet per minute” before impact (from flight data). The aircraft was also heavily fuelled for its long-haul journey, intensifying the post-crash fire.

Aviation analysts have noted that flight data monitoring on the 787 is extensive and should provide clear insights once the flight recorders are recovered.

## Global Reactions

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the crash “[heartbreaking beyond words](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/heartbreaking-beyond-words-pm-modi-on-ahmedabad-air-crash/article69686716.ece)" and confirmed ongoing coordination with emergency services.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and King Charles III offered condolences, with the British government deploying crisis support teams. The U.K. has deep cultural and familial ties with India, where nearly 1.9 million residents have Indian heritage.

Air India Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran confirmed the airline had set up an emergency centre and was focused on supporting families of victims. Boeing acknowledged the incident and is cooperating with authorities. Its shares fell nearly 9% in early trading.
