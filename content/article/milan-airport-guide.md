A city renowned for its fashion, art, and culture, Milan is also a bustling hub of international travel. At the heart of Italy, it’s served by three major airports - Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, and Bergamo Orio al Serio. Together, these airports serve as gateways to the fashion capital of the world, welcoming millions of travelers annually. 

In this comprehensive guide, I'll take you on a journey through the history, terminals, services, airlines and destinations of all three Milan's airports, revealing how they have evolved into crucial transportation hubs in Europe.

## Milan Malpensa Airport

### History

Milan Malpensa Airport ([MXP](https://www.milanomalpensa-airport.com/en/)), located 49 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Milan, has a rich history dating back to 1910. Originally built to test aircraft prototypes, it became a civilian airport in 1948.

On February 2, 1950, Trans World Airlines (TWA) became the first to fly long-haul flights from Malpensa Airport. They used Lockheed Constellations for their services, connecting Malpensa to New York Idlewild Airport, now known as John F. Kennedy International Airport ([JFK](https://www.jfkairport.com/)). 

Between 1958 and 1962 a new terminal was built, and the Malpensa's two parallel runways were extended to an impressive 3,920 meters (12,861 feet), making them the longest runways in Europe at that time.

However, Malpensa faced a downturn in its commercial traffic in the following years. The number of passengers dropped from 525,000 in 1960 to 331,000 by 1965. This decline was attributed to European carriers like British Airways, Air France, Lufthansa, and Alitalia, who shifted the majority of their operations to Linate Airport, due to its proximity to the center of Milan.

By the mid-80s Linate Airport was facing issues related to expansion, and the focus shifted towards Malpensa again. To help bring traffic to the airport, a plan known as ‘[Malpensa 2000](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43041901)‘ was initiated. This encompassed the construction of a new terminal and the establishment of efficient transport links to Milan's city center. The decree was passed in 1985 by the Italian Parliament. Construction at the Malpensa commenced in November 1990 and was finished by 1998. 

### Terminals

Malpensa Airport boasts two terminals: Terminal 1 and Terminal 2. Both are connected through free airport shuttle buses and trains.
