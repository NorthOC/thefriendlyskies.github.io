Boeing resumed 787 Dreamliner aircraft deliveries on August 10, as reported by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

For the most part of the last two years, the delivery of wide-body jetliners was paused until regulatory agencies and Boeing reviewed several production defects. Boeing and its customers, such as American Airlines and United Airlines, who had high demand for travel this year, had to wait for the resumption of deliveries for new Dreamliner aircraft for a long time.

The FAA reported that before issuing an airworthiness certificate and allowing the aircraft to be delivered, the FAA will inspect each plane. "Boeing made necessary changes to ensure that the 787 Dreamliner meets all certification standards."

Last month, Boeing announced that it was nearing the resumption of 787 aircraft deliveries, which CEO Dave Calhoun referred to as "the moment we've been waiting for." At the end of last quarter, the company had 120 of these aircraft in inventory, according to a securities filing.

Last Thursday, Billy Nolen, who serves as the FAA administrator, visited the Boeing 787 factory in South Carolina and met with FAA safety inspectors to discuss measures to improve production quality, the agency reported. Among other things, small, incorrect gaps were found in some fuselage parts. "We continue to work transparently with the FAA and our customers towards resuming 787 deliveries," Boeing said in a statement.
