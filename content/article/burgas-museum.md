Before taking a flight from Burgas, Bulgaria, I spent a few hours exploring one of the best aviation museums I have ever visited, Aviomuseum Burgas. Located at the entrance to Burgas Airport ([BOJ](https://burgas-airport.bg/)), it is very easy to find.

Opened in 2017, the museum charges an entrance fee of only 6 LV (2€ or $3.35). The exhibits include Bulgarian civil and military aircraft from 1960 to 1996, such as an AN-12 transport aircraft, a TU-154 airliner, and many more that I will cover in this article.

## Aviomuseum Burgas: What I Found?

I discovered the following aircraft: Tu-154, An-12, An-24, MiG-17, MiG-21, L-29, An-2, An-14, Ka-26, and Mi-2. Although not part of the museum, about 100 meters away, an entire IL-14 aircraft sits on a roundabout at the airport entrance.

{{< img src="/19072024/2.jpg" id="i_plane" caption="Photo taken by Rosita Mickeviciute, 2024" alt="Ilyushin Il-12 on a grass">}} 

Visitors also have the unique opportunity to climb into the cockpits of several aircraft, including the MiG-17, MiG-21, Tu-154, and An-2.

The [impressive interactive exhibit](https://www.gotoburgas.com/en/places-to-go/view/552), Homo Volans (The Flying Man), is in an An-12 aircraft. This exhibit features numerous authentic items, airplane models, costumes, installations, and archives from aviation history.

{{< img src="/19072024/4.jpg" id="i_plane" caption="Photo taken by Rosita Mickeviciute, 2024" alt="old grey aviation costume">}} 

Some things that caught my attention included a black box, which could record up to 8 hours of data, oxygen tanks shaped like hyotan (Japanese sake bottles), and a Tu-134 engine (outside near An-12).

{{< img src="/19072024/7.jpg" id="i_plane" caption="Photo taken by Rosita Mickeviciute, 2024" alt="tu-134 engine">}} 

The Tu-154 airliner has been restored to reflect the 1970s style of Balkan Bulgarian Airlines. It was fascinating to see the ample space in the economy section, which was quite unusual compared to modern aircraft.

The museum's goals extend beyond preserving these aircraft for future generations. They aim to develop the site as a center for learning about aviation technology, and highlighting the importance of Bulgarian civil aviation.

I really enjoyed my time there, as it was not only interesting to see the old aircraft and their designs, but also fascinating to witness so many man-made machines that have revolutionized the way we travel today.

Now, I would like to share with you the history and performance details of each aircraft below.

## Tupolev TU-154

The TU-154, specifically the Tu-154B-2 variant, entered the Civil Force Registry in April 1981 under the [Balkan Bulgarian Airlines](https://avioburgas.bg/tu-154/). It was used to transport the passengers, with its inaugural flight being to the city of Manchester, England. From June 1992 to June 1994, this aircraft operated under the Macedonian flag.

{{< img src="/19072024/12.jpg" id="i_plane" caption="Photo taken by Rosita Mickeviciute, 2024" alt="tu-154 before restoration">}} 

The Tu-154B-2[ made its final landing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiMcAKaVdlo) on October 31, 1996, at Burgas Airport, concluding its 15 years of service with the Bulgarian Civil Aviation.

{{< img src="/19072024/13.jpg" id="i_plane" caption="Photo taken by Rosita Mickeviciute, 2024" alt="the back of tu-154">}} 

The TU-154 had its first flight on October 3, 1968, and a total of 1,026 units were built. The aircraft typically operated with a crew of four, including a captain, first officer, flight engineer, and navigator. It had a passenger capacity ranging from 164 to 180. As of today, there are [40 TU-154 aircraft still in operation](https://russianplanes.net/planelist/Tupolev/Tu-154#operators), with the Russian Air Force flying the majority, totaling 19 planes.

## Antonov AN-2 

The AN-2, specifically the AN-2P variant, was manufactured in 1970 and [delivered to Bulgaria in January 1971](https://avioburgas.bg/an-2/). It was used for aerochemical operations, crop dusting, cargo services, and more. 

{{< img src="/19072024/16.jpg" id="i_plane" caption="Photo taken by Rosita Mickeviciute, 2024" alt="an-2p aircraft">}} 

The aircraft's last flight took place in May 1989, and it was officially retired in November 1992 after reaching a total of 11,354 flight hours, nearing its limit of 12,000 hours. The AN-2 served in Bulgaria for 19 years.

{{< img src="/19072024/17.jpg" id="i_plane" caption="Photo taken by Rosita Mickeviciute, 2024" alt="inside an-2">}} 

A total of 18,000 AN-2 were built. Its first flight was on August 31, 1947. The aircraft had a crew of 1-2 and could carry 12 passengers. Some AN-2s are still in operation today, though the [exact number is unclear](https://simpleflying.com/antonov-an-3-origin-story/), estimated to be [less than 10](https://afterburner.com.pl/in-search-of-the-successor-an-2-for-the-21st-century/).

## Antonov-14

The An-14 was produced in 1970 with the intention of replacing the An-2 but ultimately proved to be less successful. The registration of this An-14 in the[ Civil Force Registry occurred in January 1971](https://avioburgas.bg/an-14/), and it was assigned to Ravnets Air Base (demolished and closed in 2000).

{{< img src="/19072024/19.jpg" id="i_plane" caption="Ad Meskens / Wikimedia" alt="Burgas Antonov An-14 Pchelka LZ-7001">}} 

The An-14 is an easy to fly aircraft, making it suitable for pilots with only a few hours of training. It was used for a variety of tasks including aerial photography, monitoring for drownings and spills, and fish passages until 1985. The aircraft served in Bulgarian agricultural aviation for 14 years. The Antonov An-28 succeeded the An-14.

A [total of 332 units](https://www.antonov.com/en/history/an-14) of the An-14 were built. Its first flight took place on March 29, 1958. The aircraft has a crew of two and can carry 6 to 8 passengers. However, it is unclear how many of these types are still in operation.

{{< img src="/19072024/20.jpg" id="i_plane" caption="Photo taken by Rosita Mickeviciute, 2024" alt="Burgas Antonov An-14 front">}} 

Interestingly 2 of An-14 can be found in Kaunas, Lithuania. One in [S. Darius and S. Girėnas Airport (EYKS)](https://www.airhistory.net/photo/701364/34-red) and another in [Gamykla Heliport (EYKG)](https://www.airhistory.net/photo/364197/34-OUTLINE).
