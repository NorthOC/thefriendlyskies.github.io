Women have played important roles in aviation since the introduction of lighter-than-air travel and the development of airplanes, helicopters, and space travel. They began piloting powered aircraft around 1908. However, before 1970, laws dictated by men often restricted women to roles of a private or supportive nature within the aviation sector.

In 2021, a study by the International Society of Women Airline Pilots (ISA) revealed that women made up less than [6% of pilots globally](https://airwaysmag.com/country-highest-female-pilots/). By 2022, the percentage of FAA-certified pilots who were women had [increased to 9.57%](https://pilotinstitute.com/women-aviation-statistics/), signaling progress towards greater gender diversity in aviation today. 

Yet, as we celebrate these advancements, it's crucial to reflect on the journey women have undertaken to shape the future of aviation throughout history. And there's no better day to do that than on March 8th, which is International Women's Day.

Therefore, I present you with a collection highlighting the remarkable women who have made significant contributions to the aviation industry.

## Starting point of women in aviation - Aida de Acosta, Thérèse Peltier, and Emma Lilian Todd

The journey began in 1903 when an American Aida de Acosta achieved the milestone of becoming the first woman to fly solo in a powered aircraft, piloting a dirigible.

Then, on July 8, 1908, in Turin, France, Thérèse Peltier undertook a solo flight covering 200 meters (656 feet). Her first experience was as a passenger alongside her friend Leon Delagrange, who instructed her in piloting. Subsequently, she gained widespread recognition as the first female airplane passenger and, following her solo flight, as the [world's first female pilot](https://fly.historicwings.com/2012/09/therese-peltier-the-first-woman-pilot/#google_vignette).

Emma Lilian Todd, a self-taught American inventor with a passion for mechanical devices, sought permission from the Richmond Borough Commissioner of Public Works to fly her airplane. Despite the attempts, her permit was refused. Nonetheless, on November 7, 1910, Todd's aircraft, piloted by Didier Masson, [performed a successful flight](https://earlyaviators.com/etodd1.htm). 

## Breaking world records - Raymonde de Laroche, Harriet Quimby, and more

Raymonde de Laroche was a pioneering French aviator. On October 22, 1909, de Laroche went to the Voisin brothers' (French aviation pioneers) base in Chalons. Due to the aircraft's single-seat design, she managed to [fly it herself](https://archive.org/details/beforeameliawome00lebo) with instructions from Voisin, who guided her from the ground. After practicing taxiing, she successfully took off and flew 300 yards (270 m). On March 8, 1910, she also became the first woman in the world to receive a pilot's license.

Marie Marvingt was another notable French aviator, athlete, and nurse. In aviation, she achieved several milestones, including being the first woman to [fly combat missions](https://fly.historicwings.com/2012/12/helene-dutrieux-and-the-coupe-femina/) as a pilot during World War I. Marvingt also pioneered air ambulance services and made contributions to the development of aviation medicine. Additionally, she participated in various aviation competitions.

Harriet Quimby, an American aviation pioneer made history in 1911 by becoming the first woman in the United States to obtain a pilot's license. In 1912, she also became the first woman to successfully fly across the English Channel.

Lydia Vissarionovna Zvereva, a Russian aviation pioneer, was the first woman in Russia to earn a pilot's license. She participated in air shows in Eastern Europe and later ran an aircraft manufacturing factory in Riga with her husband. On May 19, 1914, she amazed a crowd at the hippodrome in Riga by performing aerobatics in a Morane monoplane, including [executing a loop](https://web.archive.org/web/20180331145954/http:/centennialofwomenpilots.com/lidia-zvereva-russia/) and becoming the first female aviator to do so.

Lyubov Golanchikova made history as the [pioneering female test pilot](https://naine.postimees.ee/4218613/viljandlanna-ljubov-galantchikoff-uks-esimesi-naisi-lennunduses-lopetas-new-yorgi-taksojuhina), testing airplanes for both Anthony Fokker and Ukrainian manufacturer Fedir Tereshchenko. During World War I, she also served as a pilot for the Red Cross.

## Earning rights to fly - Phoebe Omlie, Marga von Etzdorf, and Ninety-Nines

Phoebe Jane Fairgrave Omlie, an American aviation trailblazer made history by becoming the first woman to obtain an airplane mechanic's license. Also, the first licensed female transport pilot, and the first woman appointed to a government position in the aviation industry. 

Phoebe was among the boldest and most daring aviation pioneers of her time. While still in her teens, she began [performing impressive stunts](https://www.womanpilot.com/aviation-pioneer-phoebe-fairgrave-omlie/) on the wing of her aircraft, with another pilot flying the plane. Fairgrave mastered wing walking, hanging below the plane by her teeth, parachuting, and even dancing on the top wing.

Marga von Etzdorf, a German aircraft pilot, made history in 1927 as the [first woman hired by an airline](https://web.archive.org/web/20140929003349/http:/www.lufthansagroup.com/en/press/news-releases/singleview/archive/2013/august/22/article/2552.html), Lufthansa. She further solidified her legacy by becoming the first woman to fly solo across Siberia, completing a journey from Germany to Tokyo, Japan.

A noteworthy organization called the Ninety-Nines, founded in 1929, has been a leading force in [empowering women in aviation](https://www.ninety-nines.org/women-in-aviation-article.htm) for almost a century.

Its name derived from the original 99 charter members, and Ninety-Nines quickly grew into a global network of female pilots united by their passion for flight. Led by influential figures such as Amelia Earhart, the Ninety-Nines became a driving force for change in the aviation community.

## International recognition of women in aviation - Mildred Mary Petre and Amelia Earhart

Mildred Mary Petre, a British record-breaker in racing motorcars, speedboat racing, and aviation during the 1920s and 1930s, made history with her round-the-world flight. This remarkable journey not only marked several record-breaking achievements, including the first crossing of the Yellow Sea and the first England-to-Japan flight but also established her as the [first woman to circumnavigate the globe](https://www.wingnet.org/rtw/RTW002B.HTM) by air.

Amelia Earhart was an iconic American aviator who gained worldwide fame for her pioneering achievements in aviation. She became one of the most well-known figures of the 20th century due to her record-setting flights and her efforts to promote women's involvement in aviation.

Earhart's most famous accomplishments include being the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean on May 20–21, 1932, and the [first person to fly solo from Hawaii](https://aviation.hawaii.gov/aviation-pioneers/amelia-earhart/) to the United States. She also set numerous altitude and speed records during her career.

Unfortunately, Amelia Earhart disappeared on July 2, 1937, during her attempted flight around the world. Despite extensive search efforts, her plane twin-engine Lockheed Electra 10-E was never found, and the exact circumstances of her disappearance remain a mystery to this day.

## Women fighter pilots - Sabiha Gökçen, WASP, and Nadezhda Popova

Sabiha Gökçen, a Turkish aviator, logged approximately 8,000 flight hours and engaged in 32 military missions during her career. At the age of 23, she made history as the world's first female fighter pilot.

It's important to note that in 1943, during World War II, the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) were created in the United States. It was a pioneering program that trained civilian women to fly military aircraft in non-combat roles, thereby freeing up male pilots for combat duty. 

The WASP played a crucial role in the war effort by ferrying aircraft, towing targets for live anti-aircraft artillery practice, and conducting other non-combat missions. Despite their significant contributions, the WASP was disbanded in 1944, and it wasn't until decades later that they were officially recognized as veterans by the United States government.

The "Night Witches" were another group of female pilots who served in the Soviet Air Forces during World War II. They were members of the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, known for their daring [nighttime bombing raids on German forces](https://www.history.com/news/meet-the-night-witches-the-daring-female-pilots-who-bombed-nazis-by-night). The nickname "Night Witches" was given to them by the German soldiers due to the sound of their wooden planes and their stealthy, deadly attacks.

Among the Night Witches, the top-scoring pilot was Nadezhda Popova, who reportedly [completed over 850 missions](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2013/07/20/nadia-popova) and earned numerous awards for her bravery and skill.

## More records and reach for the sky - Two Jacquelines, Valentina Tereshkova, and Mercury 13
Jacqueline Cochran, an American aviator and business leader, made significant strides in aviation history. In 1937, she was the sole female competitor in the Bendix race and collaborated with Amelia Earhart to advocate for women's participation in the event. 

Cochran achieved another milestone on May 18, 1953, by becoming the [first woman to break the sound barrier](https://web.archive.org/web/20131020101951/https:/www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/jacqueline_cochran.html) with her North American F-86 Saber. Additionally, she served as the wartime leader of the WASP and later supported the Mercury 13 women astronaut program as a sponsor.

The Mercury 13 was a group of 13 American women who underwent the same rigorous testing as the male astronauts selected for NASA's Mercury program in 1959. Despite demonstrating exceptional [physical and mental capabilities](https://twudigital.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16283coll39), the Mercury 13 was not officially accepted into the astronaut program due to their gender.

Jacqueline Auriol, a notable French aviator set numerous world speed records. On August 3, 1953, Auriol even surpassed Cochran's speed with a Dassault Mystère II aircraft, securing her place as the fastest woman in the world at that time.

In the late 1950s, setting new boundaries, the space race commenced. The first woman in space was Valentina Tereshkova, a Soviet cosmonaut. She made her historic flight aboard the Vostok 6 spacecraft on June 16, 1963, and orbited the Earth 48 times over the course of 3 days. Tereshkova's mission made her the [first woman to reach space](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESA_history/50_years_of_humans_in_space/First_woman_in_space_Valentina) and, at 26 years old during the flight, the youngest person to have done so, paving the way for future generations of female astronauts

Galina Gavrilovna Korchuganova, on the other hand, was a Soviet test pilot and champion in aerobatics. Excelling in competitions, Korchuganova made history by becoming the [first women's world aerobatics champio](https://www.ninety-nines.org/pdf/newsmagazine/20040506.pdf)n in 1966.

## The new age of women in aviation - Turi Widerøe and Lynn Rippelmeyer

Turi Widerøe was a Norwegian aviator and the [world's first woman to work as a commercial airline pilot](https://e24.no/naeringsliv/i/Qo8PdQ/kvinnemangel-i-cockpiten-kvinnemangel-i-cockpiten) for a major airline. In 1968 she started working for SAS (Scandinavian Airlines System). After graduating in 1969, she became a co-pilot on Convair 440 Metropolitan.

Lynn Rippelmeyer began her aviation journey as a TWA flight attendant in 1972. In 1978, she transferred to become a TWA B-727 flight engineer. She became the [first woman to fly the Boeing 747 as a captain](https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/lynn-ripplemeyer/) in 1984 on a trans-oceanic flight, and the first flight attendant to transition to become an airline pilot.
