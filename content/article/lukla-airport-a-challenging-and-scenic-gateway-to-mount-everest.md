Nestled high in the Himalayan mountains of Nepal, Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA), also known as Lukla Airport, serves as a remarkable yet formidable gateway to the world's tallest peak, Mount Everest. With its breathtaking, rugged terrain and unpredictable weather conditions, this small airport is a vital lifeline for trekkers and climbers eager to embark on their journey to conquer Everest. 

In this article I will unravel the story of Luka, dubbed the world's most dangerous airport, exploring both the unparalleled beauty of its location and the challenges it poses to pilots. 

## History of Lukla Airport

Lukla Airport was built in 1964, as part of the Himalayan Trust project to provide accessibility to the remote Solu-Khumbu region in Nepal. 

The airport is named in honor of Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, the first climbers to conquer Mount Everest, who played a pivotal role in its construction. Sir Edmund Hillary's initial intention was to construct Tenzing-Hillary Airport on flat-level terrain, but he faced resistance from local farmers unwilling to part with their land. Consequently, Hillary opted to establish the airport on the slopes of Lukla mountain instead. He purchased the land from local Sherpas for a total of US$2,650.

Over the years, the airport has undergone several expansions and renovations, but its basic infrastructure remains modest. The single runway, which stands at an elevation of 9,337 feet (2,846 meters) above sea level, is a mere 1,729 feet (527 meters) long. This short and steeply sloping runway is the first indicator of the challenges pilots face while landing and taking off at Lukla.

## Gateway to Everest

Lukla Airport's significance extends beyond its history. It has also been instrumental in opening up the Everest region to tourism. Prior to its opening, reaching the remote villages and trekking routes in the area was a grueling task that required days of hiking. The introduction of scheduled flights at Lukla significantly reduced the time and effort needed to access the world's tallest peak. Now it takes only 25 to 30 minutes to fly to Lukla from Nepal's capital Kathmandu. 

## Why is it considered the most dangerous airport in the world?

Lukla Airport has earned its reputation as [the most dangerous airport in the world](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/travel/2023/08/03/most-dangerous-airport-lukla-nepal-cprog-orig-fj.cnn) for several reasons:

### Extreme weather conditions

Nestled in the Himalayas, Lukla is subject to unpredictable weather patterns, especially during the peak climbing seasons. Sudden changes in weather can result in thick fog, rain and heavy winds, making it nearly impossible for pilots to land or take off. While the airport remains operational year-round, visibility issues lead to the closure of the airport for 50% of the time during the monsoon season, resulting in the cancellation of half of all flights.

### High altitude challenges

The airport's high elevation significantly reduces the air density, which in turn affects engine performance and lift. This forces aircraft to land and take off with reduced engine power, increasing the risk of accidents.

### Limited runway length

The airport's runway is incredibly short, providing little margin for error. Planes must come to a halt quickly after landing, and during takeoff they must achieve enough speed in the limited space available to become airborne. There is simply no room for overshooting or undershooting the runway.

## Incidents and accidents

Since 1964, Lukla Airport has witnessed a total of 11 accidents and incidents, of which seven have proved fatal, taking the lives of over 50 people. These are some examples:

- **Runway overshoots**: On June 30, 2005, a Dornier 228 operated by Gorkha Airlines skidded off Lukla Airport's runway during its landing attempt. On October 12, 2010, another Dornier 228, operated by Sita Air, experienced a loss of braking control during its landing. The aircraft struck the end of the runway wall, resulting in damage to its nose. 

- **Accidents during landing**: On September 26, 2013, an Air Dynasty helicopter crashed when its rear rotor contacted the barbed wire of the airport's compound wall. On May 27, 2017, during the final approach, Summit Air Flight 409, which was conducting a freight flight from Kathmandu to Lukla, suffered poor visibility. The aircraft, a Let L-410, lost altitude and collided with a tree just short of the runway. 

- **Aircraft crashes**: On October 8, 2008, Yeti Airlines Flight 103, operated using a DHC-6 Twin Otter 300, crashed and caught fire during its final approach, claiming the lives of eighteen passengers and crew members. This incident stands as the one with the highest number of fatalities on the airport's premises. Video footage of the incident showed adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash.

In response to these challenges and incidents, the Nepalese government and aviation authorities have implemented safety measures such as special [pilot training, improved weather forecasting](https://reports.aviation-safety.net/2017/20170527-0_L410_9N-AKY.pdf), and [runway improvements](https://reports.aviation-safety.net/2008/20081008-0_DHC6_9N-AFE.pdf). In order to operate at Lukla, pilots are now required to fulfill the following qualifications:

- Must have conducted 100 short-takeoff-and-landing flights.
- Must possess a minimum of one year of short takeoff and landing (STOL) experience in Nepal.
- Must have successfully completed ten flights into Lukla under the guidance of a certified instructor.

Despite these efforts, though, Lukla remains a perilous destination for aviators and passengers alike.

## Airlines and destinations

Several airlines operate flights to and from Lukla, with destinations primarily catering to trekkers, climbers and adventurers. The only local airlines operating to and from Lukla include Tara Air, Summit Air, and Sita Air. The only destinations connected to Lukla are Kathmandu, Manthali and Phaplu.

## Aircraft permitted to operate at Lukla

Due to the airport's challenging environment, only certain types of aircraft, including helicopters and turboprops, are allowed to operate at the airport. These typically include de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, Dornier 228, Let L-410 Turbolet, and Pilatus PC-6 aircraft, known for STOL capabilities. Additionally, pilots must meet specific qualifications and experience requirements to operate in these challenging conditions.

## Passenger numbers

Lukla Airport now plays a significant role in the local economy and tourism industry. It serves as the primary gateway for trekkers and climbers visiting the Everest region, contributing substantially to the local economy. 

On average, it handles over 90,000 passengers annually, with numbers increasing each year as interest in the Everest region continues to grow. In 2019, the total number of passengers reached 129,508, but the peak year in terms of passenger arrivals remains 2017, when the airport welcomed 146,879 individuals.

During the peak season, Lukla Airport operates more than 50 daily flights, serving as the only gateway to the Everest Base Camp. The peak seasons run from April 1st to May 30th and October 1st to November 30th each year.

## Conclusion

Lukla Airport, with its storied history and reputation as the world's most dangerous airport, continues to captivate adventurers and explorers. Its role in opening up the Everest region for tourism cannot be overstated. 

However, the challenges it presents, including extreme weather conditions, high altitude concerns and a limited runway, make it a destination where every flight is something of an adventure in itself. Despite these dangers, though, Lukla Airport remains a vital conduit to the Roof of the World, facilitating extraordinary experiences for those seeking to conquer the Everest region.
