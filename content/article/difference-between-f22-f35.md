In today's rapidly evolving world of military aviation, two standout fighter jets steal the spotlight: the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II. 

Both born from the innovations of Lockheed Martin, these fifth-generation fighter jets each bring unique strengths to modern air warfare.

Without further ado, let’s dive into the differences between the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning.

## F-22 Raptor overview

The F-22 Raptor is an advanced fifth-generation fighter jet renowned for its capabilities in air superiority. With its sleek design and cutting-edge features, the F-22 boasts supersonic cruise speeds, exceptional maneuverability and a lethal combination of radar-evading stealth and precision weaponry. 

Equipped with advanced sensors and avionics, the Raptor can operate seamlessly in contested airspace, providing the United States Air Force (USAF) with a [crucial edge in aerial dominance](https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/134780/). 

The development of the F-22 Raptor began in the early 1980s at Lockheed Martin, where it underwent a lengthy and complex process. It was designed as a future replacement for the aging F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets. Also, it was specifically designed to counter advanced Russian aircraft like the Su-27 and MiG-29.

Northrop and McDonnell Douglas developed the YF-23 as their proposal for a new fighter jet. Meanwhile, Lockheed, Boeing, and General Dynamics built the YF-22. 

The YF-23 made its first flight on August 27, 1990, while the YF-22 followed shortly after, on September 29, 1990.

Although the YF-22 [was slightly slower and had a larger radar cross-section](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/yf-23-black-widow-fighter-plane-almost-replaced-f-22-raptor-209468), it was more agile than the YF-23, which made a big difference in close combat.

After several years of testing and refinement, the F-22 Raptor officially entered service with USAF on December 15, 2005.

## F-35 Lighting overview

The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is a fifth-generation, multi-role stealth fighter jet designed for superior air combat, ground attack, surveillance, and intelligence missions. 

The F-35 Lightning II program includes several variants, such as the F-35A for the USAF, the F-35B (known for its short takeoff and vertical landing capabilities) for the US Marine Corps, and the F-35C (designed for carrier-based operations) for the US Navy. The newest variant F-35I "Adir" ([translated from Hebrew](https://web.archive.org/web/20170728140034/https://www.f35.com/news/detail/israels-first-f-35-lightning-ii-takes-flight) as "Awesome" or "Mighty") is a customized version of the F-35A, featuring unique Israeli modifications. Also, Israel has integrated its own electronic warfare systems into the aircraft.

The F-35 is equipped with the [most advanced sensor suite ever built into a fighter jet](https://www.f35.com/f35/news-and-features/f35-the-worlds-most-advanced-fighter.html), featuring an Active Electronically Scanned Array radar, Distributed Aperture System, Electro-Optical Targeting System, and other electronic warfare capabilities to detect adversaries and disrupt their attacks.

The F-35 Lightning II commenced development in the early 1990s. The program aimed to create a family of stealth multirole combat aircraft to meet the diverse needs of the USAF, US Navy, US Marine Corps, and several allied nations. 

In early 1997, Boeing and Lockheed Martin were selected for the Concept Demonstration Phase, with their aircraft prototypes designated as the X-32 and X-35, respectively. McDonnell Douglas was eliminated, while Northrop Grumman and British Aerospace joined Lockheed Martin's team.

Both companies were tasked with producing two prototype aircraft to demonstrate conventional takeoff and landing, carrier operations, and short takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL). During testing, Lockheed Martin’s X-35 successfully [demonstrated both STOVL and supersonic flight ](https://www.twz.com/44157/test-pilot-explains-why-the-x-32-lost-to-what-became-the-f-35)without any modifications, while Boeing’s X-32 required maintenance adjustments before operating in STOVL mode. 

The X-35 made its maiden flight on October 24, 2000, and ultimately won the competition, leading to the development of the F-35 Lightning II.

## Differences between the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II

The F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II are two distinct fifth-generation fighter aircraft developed by Lockheed Martin for the USAF. While they share some similarities in their technology, they were built for distinct primary roles and feature several important differences.

### Role and mission

#### F-22 Raptor

- **Air Superiority**: The F-22 was primarily designed as an air superiority fighter, meaning its primary role is to gain and maintain control of the airspace and engage enemy aircraft in dogfights.
- **Maneuverability**: Known for [unmatched maneuverability](https://www.eurasiantimes.com/f-35-pilot-compares-f-22-raptor-with-f-35-explains/) and agility.
- **Stealth**: The F-22 is considered the [stealthiest fighter jet in the world](https://avi-8.com/blogs/the-aviation-journal/the-f-22-raptor-the-worlds-most-advanced-stealth-fighter), with a minimized radar cross-section and infrared signature, allowing it to operate in contested airspace.

#### F-35 Lightning II

- **Multi-Role**: The F-35 is designed as a multi-role fighter, capable of performing a wide range of missions, including air-to-air combat, air-to-ground strikes, electronic warfare and reconnaissance.
- **Maneuverability**: Designed for good maneuverability, but not to the same extent as the F-22.
- **Stealth**: Though the F-35 is certainly stealthy, it places a greater emphasis on versatility and multi-role capabilities, as opposed to the extreme stealth capabilities of the F-22.

### Armament

- **Weapon Payload**: The F-35 can carry a larger payload with **up to 18,000 pounds** of internal and external weapons, compared to the F-22’s total payload of around **12,000 pounds**. 
- **Weapon Variety**: The F-35 supports a [**broader range of weapons**](https://www.key.aero/article/what-weapons-can-f-35-carry-global-armaments-list), covering both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. Its arsenal includes **air-to-air missiles** (e.g., AIM-120 AMRAAM, AIM-9X Sidewinder) and advanced **air-to-surface munitions** such as the **AGM-158 JASSM** (a long-range cruise missile), and the **B61 mod 12 nuclear bomb**. Additionally, it has **anti-ship capability** through weapons like the **AGM-158C LRASM**. The F-22, by contrast, lacks such extensive air-attack and anti-ship capabilities.

### Speed and altitude

- **F-22**: The F-22 Raptor can achieve higher speeds compared to the F-35. It has a maximum speed of around **1,500 miles per hour** (mph) (nearly twice the speed of sound) and can reach altitudes of up to **50,000 feet** (ft).
- **F-35**: Although fast, the F-35 doesn't match the top speed of the F-22. The F-35 can reach a maximum speed of around **1,200 mph**, or **Mach 1.6**, and is capable of flying at altitudes of up to **50,000 ft**.

### Variants and operational use

- **F-22**: There's only one primary variant.
- **F-35**: The program includes **three primary variants** (A, B, C) tailored to different operational requirements.
- **F-22**: Operates mainly within the USAF.
- **F-35**: Operates in **multiple branches**, including the USAF, US Marine Corps, US Navy and several international partners.

### Number built

- **F-22**: A total of **186** operational aircraft have been built.
- **F-35:** Over **1,000** aircraft have been built.
