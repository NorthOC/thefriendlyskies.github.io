### King Air 360 and 360ER
The Beechcraft Super King Air family comprises a range of twin-turboprop aircraft manufactured by Beechcraft. Since its introduction to the civilian sector in 1974, it has become a highly reliable aircraft company. 

Its newest aircraft model [introduced in August 2020](https://www.flightglobal.com/business-aviation/textron-introduces-king-air-360/139608.article), the King Air 360 and 360 Extended Range (ER), are powered by the [Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-60A turboprop](https://beechcraft.txtav.com/en/king-air-360er) engines and feature the IS&S ThrustSense Autothrottle system. 

The [ThrustSense Autothrottle](https://innovative-ss.com/products/autothrottle-for-turboprop/) enables pilots to automatically manage the engine's power setting. This system calculates and adjusts power levels as needed, thereby reducing pilot workload and improving safety.

The King Air 360 operates with a maximum cruise speed of 312 kn (578 km) and a maximum operating altitude of 35,000 ft. The 360ER has a slightly lower maximum cruise speed at 303 kn (561 km).

360ER can accommodate 15 passengers, which is four seats more than the 360 model. Also, the extended-range model boasts a range of 2,539 nm (4,702 km), [surpassing the 360's range](https://beechcraft.txtav.com/en/king-air-360) by 700 miles. One of the standout features of the 360ER is its impressive useful load, totaling 7,174 lb. In contrast, the 360 has a 2,000 lb lighter useful load. This makes the 360ER an ideal choice for consumers who require the capability to transport large loads over longer distances.

The price for the new King Air 360 is [around $8.5 million](https://www.aircraftcostcalculator.com/AircraftOperatingCosts/732/Beechcraft+King+Air+360), and for the 360 ER, it's a little bit more at [around $8.9 million](https://www.aircharteradvisors.com/king-air-360/).
