In aerial combat, speed is everything. Whether it's an air superiority fighter built to dominate the skies, an interceptor designed for rapid response, or a multirole jet capable of long-range missions, getting into the fight quickly can make all the difference.

So, which fighter jet is the fastest?

As of 2025, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 holds the record, reaching Mach 2.83. Its successor, the MiG-31, comes close, but both are nearly obsolete. Only two MiG-25s remain active out of 1,186 built, while 128 MiG-31s are still in service out of 500 produced. For combat-ready, widely used fighters, the F-15 Eagle takes the top spot. With over 900 in service and ongoing modernization efforts, including the latest F-15EX, it remains a dominant force in the skies.

This list only includes fighter aircraft that are currently in service. Legendary jets like the F-111 Aardvark, XB-70, and X-43 have been excluded as they are retired.

Every plane listed can exceed Mach 2.0 (1,520 mph), meaning they can fly at twice the speed of sound or faster. For reference, Mach speed is relative to the speed of sound, which at 20°C (68°F) is approximately 767 mph or 1,235 km/h. Also, this ranking is based solely on max speed and does not factor in maneuverability, combat effectiveness, or age.

We will start the countdown from the 10th slowest aircraft and move to the 1st spot, the fastest fighter jet currently in service. Let’s start! 

## 10. McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II

### Max Speed: Mach 2.23 (1,470 mph, 2,365 km/h)

The F-4 Phantom is a third-generational and one of the most iconic fighter jets of the Cold War era. Manufactured between 1958 and 1981, a total of [5,195 units were produced](https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/museums/nnam/explore/collections/aircraft/f/f-4n-phantom-ii.html). Its first flight occurred on May 27, 1958.

Although retired by most of its former operators, the aircraft remains in active service with several air forces. According to the [2025 World Air Forces directory](https://www.flightglobal.com/defence/2025-world-air-forces-directory/160846.article) compiled by [FlightGlobal](https://www.flightglobal.com/), Turkey operates 48 F-4E Phantoms, Greece 17 F-4Es, and Iran 65 F-4D/E and RF-4E variants. Meanwhile, South Korea retired the last of its F-4E Phantoms in 2024.

Despite its less-than-aerodynamic design, the F-4 Phantom achieves high speeds because of its engines. It is powered by two General Electric J79-GE-17 engines. This engine was also used in the Convair B-58 Hustler—the [first operational bomber](https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/197630/general-electric-j79-turbojet/) capable of sustaining speeds above Mach 2.

Interestingly, the F-4 was designed without an internal cannon, as its primary role was a fleet defense fighter. Later on, Phantom’s mission shifted to engaging enemy bombers from long range using advanced missiles. Early Royal Air Force (RAF) versions were equipped with AIM-9G Sidewinder missiles, providing a [stern-hemisphere capability](https://www.david-gledhill.co.uk/the-phantom/the-sidewinder/). Meaning, a heat-seeking missile tracks the infrared radiation emitted by the jet exhaust of target aircraft. It was optimized for close-range combat and had a significantly shorter range than other versions.

Throughout its service in combat, the Phantom achieved [over 320 aerial victories](https://sandiegoairandspace.org/collection/item/mcdonnell-douglas-f-4j-s-phantom-ii). The F-4 also set numerous records for in-flight performance. Between 1959 and 1960, it achieved [15 world records](https://web.archive.org/web/20110629074601/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/firsts.htm), including an absolute speed record and an absolute altitude record, cementing its reputation as a high-performance aircraft.

## 9. Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor

### Max Speed: Mach 2.25 (1,500 mph, 2,414 km/h)

The [F-22 Raptor](https://thefriendlyskies.net/article/difference-between-f22-f35/) is the first operational fifth-generation fighter and the only stealth aircraft featured on this list. This single-seat fighter jet was primarily designed for air superiority but also includes ground attack, electronic warfare, and radical maneuvering capabilities.

Equipped with a sophisticated sensor suite, the F-22 allows its pilot to detect, track, and engage air-to-air threats before being spotted. For air-to-air combat, it carries six AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles and two AIM-9 Sidewinders. Its air-to-ground loadout includes a combination of JDAMs or SDBs alongside air-to-air missiles, stored in internal weapon bays to preserve stealth and reduce drag. However, F-22 Raptor has [never shot down another plane](https://simpleflying.com/f-22-raptor-no-plane-shootdowns-analysis/), its only kills have been surveillance balloons.

The F-22’s advanced stealth capabilities are so sensitive that the aircraft is [restricted from export](https://www.slashgear.com/1756877/jet-fighter-why-united-states-ban-export-f-22-raptor/) and remains exclusive to the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Production started in 1996 and ended in 2011 with only 195 units built ([8 test and 187 production aircraft](https://web.archive.org/web/20160313044134/http://www.combataircraft.net/view_article.asp?id=4994)), out of which [178 are still operational](https://www.flightglobal.com/defence/2025-world-air-forces-directory/160846.article). Aircraft’s first flight occurred on September 7, 1996.

Unlike many older jets that struggle to exceed the sound barrier at low altitudes, the F-22 can maintain speeds [above Mach 1.2](https://trends.aeroexpo.online/project-79480.html) at sea level and supercruise at over Mach 1.8 without afterburners. This capability is powered by two Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 engines with two-dimensional thrust vectoring. Supercruise allows the Raptor to sustain supersonic speeds with significantly reduced fuel consumption, enhancing its range and effectiveness in combat scenarios.

## 8. IAI Kfir

### Max Speed: Mach 2.3 (1,520 mph, 2,446 km/h)

The Kfir is a third-generation multirole combat aircraft developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) as a modified version of the French Dassault Mirage 5. It is equipped with an American General Electric J79 turbojet engine, the same engine used in the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II.

The Kfir's development was driven by a [French arms embargo](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/kfir-israeli-fighter-jet-no-nation-dared-battle-sky-210366/) in the late 1960s, which left Israel without access to spare parts or upgrades for its Mirage fleet. In response, Israel reverse-engineered the Mirage 5 and created an enhanced, domestically produced version—the Kfir, meaning "Lion Cub" in Hebrew.

One of the aircraft's most significant upgrades was the already mentioned J79-J1E turbojet engine, which was considerably more powerful than the Mirage 5’s original SNECMA Atar 9C. This engine choice significantly [improved the Kfir's performance](https://militaeraktuell.at/en/israel-50-years-of-kfir-the-lion-of-the-air/), making it faster than the original Mirage design. To accommodate the new engine, Israeli engineers had to implement major structural and aerodynamic modifications, including enlarging the air intakes and reinforcing the fuselage.

A total of over 220 Kfirs were built, with the aircraft’s first flight taking place in June 1973. Production ran from 1976 to 1986. As of 2025, [16 Kfirs remain in operation](https://www.flightglobal.com/defence/2025-world-air-forces-directory/160846.article) with the Colombian Aerospace Force, three of which are used for training.

The IAI Kfir is armed with two Rafael-built DEFA 553 cannons, along with FFAR and Zuni unguided air-to-ground rockets, and can carry up to four AIM-9 Sidewinders or Python-series air-to-air missiles. The Kfir’s [only confirmed air-to-air victory](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/israel/kfir.htm#google_vignette) during its service with the Israeli Air Force occurred on June 27, 1979, when a Kfir C.2 shot down a Syrian MiG-21.

## 7. Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29

### Max Speed: Mach 2.3 (1,520 mph, 2,446 km/h)

The MiG-29, nicknamed "Fulcrum", is a fourth-generation multirole fighter jet, was designed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War as a lighter counterpart to the Sukhoi Su-27 and a response to the American F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon jets. Since its first flight on October 6, 1977, and its introduction into service in 1981, the MiG-29 has remained in production and continues to be a vital asset for various air forces worldwide.

The MiG-29 is known for its agility, maneuverability, and [resistance to spins](https://www.eurasiantimes.com/mig-29-a-super-seller-mig-35-no-takers-why/). One of its key advantages is its ability to take off and land on rough runways. Additionally, the aircraft is capable of [mid-air refueling](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/discover-the-10-fastest-jets-in-the-world/articleshow/114150354.cms), further extending its operational range.

With continuous modernization and upgrades, the MiG-29 has remained in service even today, serving in over 22 countries, including Russia. As of 2025, it is the [fifth most widely used combat aircraft in the world](https://www.flightglobal.com/defence/2025-world-air-forces-directory/160846.article), with 788 active units. In total, [over 1,600 MiG-29s](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/reason-america-bought-21-mig-29-russian-built-fighter-jets-207500/) have been built.

MiG-29 is equipped with two Klimov RD-33 afterburning turbofan engines, which provide the aircraft with [high thrust and robust cooling system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NiSYUHsSh8). However, they lack Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC), meaning that if the FADEC system fails, the engine fails too. However, it is unlikely because of [system redundancy](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2022-01/Full%20Authority%20Digital%20Engine%20Control%20\(FADEC\).pdf).

The MiG-29 carries a GSh-30-1 autocannon and has seven hardpoints for air-to-air missiles like the R-27 and R-73, air-to-ground rockets such as the S-5, S-8, and S-24, and bombs like the FAB-500.

The exact number of aerial victories achieved by the MiG-29 remains uncertain, but it is estimated to be at least [6 confirmed kills](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/mig-29-combat.htm).

{{< img src="/20022025/4.webp" id="i\_plane" caption="Julian Herzog / Wikimedia" alt="Polish Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29A Fulcrum">}}

## 6. Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23

### Max Speed: Mach 2.35 (1,520 mph, 2,446 km/h)

The MiG-23, a third-generation swing-wing fighter, was developed in the early 1960s as a replacement for the MiG-21. Over 5,000 units were produced across various variants, making it the [most widely manufactured variable-sweep wing aircraft](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/aircraft/mikoyan-gurevich-mig-23.html) in history. MiG-23 first took flight on June 10, 1967, and was manufactured from 1967 to 1985.

Designed for both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, it [remains in service today](https://www.flightglobal.com/defence/2025-world-air-forces-directory/160846.article), with Angola, North Korea, Syria, Ethiopia, and several other nations operating a total of 187 active units. The MiG-23 earned its longevity due to its sturdy construction and high performance. It was also the [first Soviet fighter ](https://www.eurasiantimes.com/syrian-rebels-capture-mig-23-fighter-jets/)to feature a look-down/shoot-down radar, the RP-23 Sapfir, and one of the earliest jets to be armed with beyond-visual-range missiles.

Equipped with the Tumansky R-29-300 engine, the MiG-23 boasted a lot of thrust, reaching a top speed of Mach 2.4. Later, the R-29B-300 variant was introduced to address performance limitations. Known by its NATO codename “Flogger", its variable-sweep wings provided agility in dogfights, allowed takeoffs from short, remote runways, and optimized aerodynamics for both supersonic and cruise flight.

Primarily built as an interceptor, the MiG-23 is less maneuverable than modern fourth-generation fighters and has relatively poor low-altitude performance. Also, despite its versatility, the MiG-23 is significantly outclassed by the MiG-29 in terms of modern weaponry and payload capabilities. Nevertheless, in the 1960s, it was among the [most advanced Soviet jets](https://militarywatchmagazine.com/article/mig23-wings-single-engine-phased-out) and remains one of the Cold War’s most iconic aircraft.

In combat, Iraqi MiG-23 pilots claimed around 20 aerial victories, including a few against F-14 Tomcats. Cuban MiG-23 pilots also claimed 6 aerial victories, though [only one was confirmed](https://web.archive.org/web/20090501071624/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_165.shtml).

{{< img src="/20022025/5.webp" id="i\_plane" caption="Stahlkocher / Wikimedia" alt="Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23MLD Flogger K">}}

## 5. Grumman F-14 Tomcat

### Max Speed: Mach 2.34 (1,544 mph, 2,485 km/h)

The F-14 Tomcat is one of the world’s first fourth-generation fighters, designed primarily as a naval interceptor for the U.S. Navy. It entered service on September 22, 1974, replacing the F-4 Phantom II. The F-14 Tomcat was manufactured from 1984 to 1991, with a total of 712 units built. The aircraft was retired by the U.S. Navy in 2006 and replaced by the F/A-18 Super Hornet. 

The F-14 is known for its variable-sweep wing design, allowing superior performance in both high-speed engagements and carrier operations. Powered by two General Electric F110-GE-400 afterburning turbofans, it was among the [most successful naval fighters](https://ig.space/commslink/how-the-f-4-phantom-ii-became-the-best-selling--supersonic-fighter-jet-plane) of its time. 

It was equipped with the AN/AWG-9 radar (later upgraded to the APG-71) and the long-range AIM-54 Phoenix missile, capable of engaging targets over 100 miles away. The F-14 was also a capable multi-role fighter, receiving upgrades (A, B, and D variants) that allowed it to carry precision-guided munitions.

During the Iran-Iraq War (1980–1988), Iranian F-14s were credited with up to [159 aerial victories ](https://web.archive.org/web/20120204042640/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_212.shtml)and achieved at least 50 air-to-air kills within the first six months of the war, against Iraqi MiG-21s, MiG-23s, and Su-20/22s. One notable incident involved an AIM-54 Phoenix missile allegedly downing four Iraqi aircraft in a single engagement.

Beyond its combat record, the F-14 gained [widespread recognition](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/f-14-tomcat-top-gun-movie-star-and-time-tested-warplane-207203) through its starring role in Hollywood, appearing in films such as *Top Gun*, *The Final Countdown*, and *Executive Decision*.

Today, Iran is the [only active F-14 operator in the world](https://www.flightglobal.com/defence/2025-world-air-forces-directory/160846.article), with 41 aircraft still in service as of 2025, though many may be non-operational due to sanctions restricting spare parts.

{{< img src="/20022025/6.webp" id="i\_plane" caption="U.S. Navy / Wikimedia" alt="The Grumman F-14B Tomcat prototype (BuNo 157986) in flight">}}

## 4. Sukhoi Su-27 

### Max Speed: Mach 2.35 (1,553 mph, 2,499 km/h)

The Su-27 Flanker was one of the most prominent fighter jets of the Cold War, creating a path to an entire family of aircraft, including the Su-30, Su-34, and other, as well as Chinese variants such as the Shenyang J-11. Designed as the [Soviet response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjLkD-73LDA) to the F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle, the Su-27 is the fourth-fastest fighter jet currently in service and a highly capable fourth-generation multirole aircraft.

A total of 680 Su-27s were built between 1982 and 2010, though its first flight took place on May 20, 1977, as the T-10 prototype, Sukhoi’s 10th design. Its derivative variants (such as the Su-30 and Su-35) [remain in active production](https://bulgarianmilitary.com/2025/01/02/russia-received-14-batches-of-su-57-su-35-su-34-and-su-30/#google_vignette) due to their advanced avionics, weapon systems, and versatility. As a family, the Su-27/30/34/35 series is the second [most widely used in-service fighter jet](https://www.flightglobal.com/defence/2025-world-air-forces-directory/160846.article) type in the world as of 2025, only losing to F-16. There are 1,284 active units, with China, India, and Russia being the largest operators.

With its long range, [supermaneuverability](https://www.bohrfranklin.org/tem/supermaneuverability-jonathan-gordon), and powerful Saturn AL-31F afterburning turbofan engines, the Su-27 Flanker is optimized for air superiority missions and dogfights. It can reach 12 km (39,000 ft) in [under a minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07tEk-9j69I), which is an impressive capability. 

A notable evolution of the Flanker is the [Su-35 "Super Flanker,"](https://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/su-35/) also referred to as the "Last Flanker." Featuring thrust-vectoring engines, an upgraded radar, and weaponry, the Su-35 has played a key role in Russia's war on Ukraine, maintaining an advantage over Ukraine’s Su-27s and other aging aircraft. The Su-27 has a recorded [kill/loss ratio of 6:0](https://migflug.com/jetflights/the-combat-statistics-for-all-the-aircraft-currently-in-use/). 

Looking ahead, Russia plans to gradually replace the Su-27 with the [Sukhoi Su-57](https://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/sukhoit50stealthfigh/), a fifth-generation, twin-engine, multirole stealth fighter.

{{< img src="/20022025/7.webp" id="i\_plane" caption="Jakub Halun / Wikimedia" alt="Sukhoi Su-27">}}

## 3. McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle

### Max Speed: Mach 2.5 (1,650 mph, 2,655 km/h)

One of the most recognizable US-made fighter jets, the F-15 Eagle is a fourth-generation aircraft operated by the USAF, Israel, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore. With 919 active units and more on order, it is the third [most widely used in-service fighter jet](https://www.flightglobal.com/defence/2025-world-air-forces-directory/160846.article) type in the world and third fastest as of 2025. 

Introduced on January 9, 1976, the F-15 was originally designed by McDonnell Douglas (now part of Boeing) as a homeland defense interceptor to counter the Soviet MiG-25 Foxbat. Over time, the air superiority-focused F-15A/B/C/D variants led to the development of the F-15E Strike Eagle, a multirole variant designed for ground attack. The latest version, the F-15EX Eagle II, entered operational service in July 2024, featuring upgraded avionics, to [replace the aging F-15C/D fleet](https://breakingdefense.com/2019/03/shanahan-ethics-agreement-out-how-the-f-15x-decision-was-made/).

With a high thrust-to-weight ratio and large wing area, the F-15 excels in dogfighting, maintaining speed even in tight turns. While initially designed to reach Mach 3.0, the requirement was reduced to Mach 2.5 to cut costs. It is powered by Pratt & Whitney F100 afterburning turbofan engines.

For air-to-ground missions, the F-15E can carry [most USAF weapons](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104499/f-15e-strike-eagle/), while for air-to-air combat, it is armed with AIM-9M Sidewinders and AIM-120 AMRAAMs.

Notably, the F-15 is the only fighter jet to have [shot down a satellite](https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/198034/vought-asm-135a-anti-satellite-missile/) and holds an unmatched air-to-air combat record with [104 aerial victories](https://aircraft.fandom.com/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-15_Eagle) and zero losses.

{{< img src="/20022025/8.webp" id="i\_plane" caption="Ethan Wagner / Wikimedia" alt="An F-15EX Eagle II">}}

## 2. Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-31 

### Max Speed: Mach 2.83 (1,864 mph, 3,000 km/h)

Known by its NATO codename “Foxhound", MiG-31 is a fourth-generation, high-speed aircraft, introduced on May 6, 1981, and manufactured from 1975 to 1994. Developed as a [replacement to the legendary MiG-25](https://odin.tradoc.army.mil/WEG/Asset/a4669ef1dd64227e040b5bfc32b11855), it was designed to overcome the performance limitations and defects of its predecessor while incorporating multirole capabilities. As of 2025, it is the second fastest fighter jet in the world.

Although the MiG-31 and MiG-25 share similar speed and performance, the MiG-31 has superior sensors, [avionics](https://airpra.com/lets-explore-the-russian-high-speed-mig-25-and-mig-31/), and weaponry. Equipped with powerful Solovov D30-F6 jet engines, it can reach Mach 1.25 at low altitude. While it could theoretically [push to Mach 3.2](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/mig-31-foxhound-russian-fighter-can-hit-mach-32-engine-could-break-210197), doing so risks engine damage, so its official top speed is Mach 2.83.

Unlike the single-seat MiG-25, the two-seat MiG-31 features a vastly improved radar system capable of tracking ten targets simultaneously and engaging four at once. Its RP-31 Zaslon-A phased array radar provides exceptional detection range and immunity to ground clutter, allowing it to intercept fast-moving jets and low-flying cruise missiles. Additionally, the MiG-31 can serve as a limited airborne warning and control system (AWACS), directing other aircraft—a significant advantage over the MiG-25.

Armed with fire-and-forget air-to-air missiles, including the R-33E and R-60M, the MiG-31 is a formidable interceptor. It can also carry anti-radiation missiles, a cannon, and even the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic ballistic missile. However, the MiG-31 is considered less agile than other jets and is relatively easy to detect on radar.

Today, the MiG-31 remains in service with Russia’s Air Force, with [128 active units](https://www.flightglobal.com/defence/how-the-global-military-fleet-shapes-up-in-our-2025-world-air-forces-review/160844.article). Kazakhstan, one of the only two countries outside the Soviet Union to operate the jet, retired its fleet in 2024. In total, over 500 MiG-31s have been built, though the aircraft has [yet to record an air-to-air kill](https://migflug.com/jetflights/the-combat-statistics-for-all-the-aircraft-currently-in-use/).

{{< img src="/20022025/9.webp" id="i\_plane" caption="Dmitriy Pichugin / Wikimedia" alt="Russian Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-31">}}

## 1. Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25

### Max Speed: Mach 2.83 (1,900 mph, 3,000 km/h)

The MiG-25 Foxbat remains the fastest fighter jet still in service today. It was manufactured between 1964 and 1984, with 1,186 units built. Designed as a Soviet supersonic interceptor and reconnaissance aircraft, the MiG-25 was one of the most feared jets of the Cold War, prompting the U.S. to develop the F-15. It was later succeeded by the MiG-31.

Built to intercept high-speed, high-altitude threats like the SR-71 Blackbird and XB-70 Valkyrie, the MiG-25 was powered by powerful Tumansky R-15(B) turbojet engines. When first spotted in reconnaissance photos, its oversized wings led Western analysts to mistakenly believe it was a highly maneuverable fighter.

The true capabilities of the MiG-25 were revealed in 1976 when Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko [defected to the U.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/07/archives/russian-lands-new-mig25-in-japan-seeking-us-refuge-soviet-pilot.html) via Japan in a MiG-25. It was discovered that the aircraft's large wings were necessary to support its immense weight. The MiG-25 had limited maneuverability, with a maximum g-load of just 2.2 with full fuel and an absolute limit of 4.5 g. One aircraft survived an unintended[ 11.5 g maneuver ](https://www.globalaircraft.org/planes/mig-25_foxbat.pl)in training, but the damage rendered it beyond repair.

Like many aircraft of its class, the MiG-25 struggled with agility and could not break the sound barrier at sea level while carrying missiles. Though its design is now outdated, it remains theoretically the fastest fighter jet ever built, holding [29 records](https://faststraights.medium.com/breaking-speed-and-altitude-records-the-mig-25-foxbat-the-fastest-and-highest-flying-869bd72c6462) and capable of reaching Mach 3.2.
