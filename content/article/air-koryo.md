Air Koryo is the flag carrier and only commercial airline of North Korea. It is state-owned, headquartered in Pyongyang, and controlled by the North Korean air force. The airline mainly connects Pyongyang with a handful of international destinations – Beijing, Shenyang, and Vladivostok – alongside limited domestic operations. 

One of its Ilyushin Il-62 aircraft also doubles as the official aircraft of North Korea’s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un. Its fleet is small and made up of aging Soviet-era designs alongside a few relatively modern Russian jets such as the Tupolev Tu-204.

## Air Koryo History

Air Koryo’s origins go back to 1950 with the creation of SOKAO (Soviet–Korean Airline), a joint venture connecting Pyongyang and Moscow. After the Korean War, operations resumed in 1953, and in 1955 the airline was reorganized as Korean Airways. Early operations relied on Lisunov Li-2s, Antonov An-2s, and Ilyushin Il-12s. By the 1960s, newer Il-14 and Il-18 aircraft were added to its fleet.

In 1975, the airline entered the jet age with Tupolev Tu-154s, allowing services to Eastern Bloc cities like Prague, East Berlin, and Moscow. The acquisition of the long-haul Ilyushin Il-62 in 1979 further expanded its capabilities, introducing direct flights to Moscow, as well as new destinations such as Sofia and Belgrade.

Interestingly, North Korea even considered [buying Concorde supersonic jets ](https://www.nknews.org/2024/05/flight-of-the-concorde-north-koreas-brief-flirtation-with-supersonic-airliners/)in the late 1970s, signing a preliminary deal with Aérospatiale and British Aerospace. However, economic constraints and Cold War politics prevented the purchase.

Following the Cold War and the decline of communist allies in Europe, routes shrank dramatically. The airline was [renamed Air Koryo in 1993](https://www.key.aero/article/only-airline-north-korea), shifting its focus mainly to China and Russia.

## Expansion in the 2000s

To modernize, Air Koryo acquired two Tupolev Tu-204s in 2007 and 2010, making it eligible to fly to Europe under international safety standards. However, even with this concession, Air Koryo’s presence in Europe has been minimal. 

The airline has also briefly expanded with flights to destinations such as Kuala Lumpur, Kuwait City, Dalian, and Shanghai, but most were later [canceled due to sanctions or political tensions](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38971655).

In 2012, aviation enthusiasts were able to fly on special “Air Koryo tours” featuring rare aircraft types like the Tu-134, Tu-154, Il-62, and An-24.

During Kim Jong Un’s leadership, the airline diversified beyond aviation, venturing into gas stations, taxis, tobacco, and even canned food products, highlighting the government’s effort to use Air Koryo as a broader commercial enterprise.

## Air Koryo Destinations

Air Koryo currently serves international routes to Beijing, Shenyang, and Vladivostok on a regular basis from Pyongyang. Seasonal and charter flights have also connected Pyongyang to cities such as Dalian, Kuala Lumpur, Kuwait City, Bangkok, Harbin, and even Seoul during short-lived inter-Korean initiatives. 

[Domestic routes](https://www.uritours.com/air-koryo/) are between Pyongyang and Mt. Paektu (Samjiyon), Mt. Chilbo (Orang), Sinuiju (Uiji), Hamhung (Sondok), and Wonsan (Kalma). However, North Korean citizens are generally [not permitted to travel outside](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateCommunism/comments/1bdfrzx/if_north_koreans_are_allowed_to_leave_the_country/) their own cities, let alone internationally, without extremely important state-sanctioned reasons.

Interestingly, some [aircraft do fly over North Korea](https://safeairspace.net/north-korea/), but these are mostly limited to Air Koryo as well as Chinese and Russian carriers operating to and from the country. Most foreign airlines—especially American carriers—are banned from using North Korea’s airspace and avoid the area altogether due to safety risks from unannounced missile tests and potential air defense threats.

## Fleet

As of 2025, Air Koryo’s fleet is one of the smallest in the world, consisting of a mix of modern and outdated aircraft:

- **2 Antonov An-148-100B** – regional jet for short-haul services
- **1 Ilyushin Il-62M** – long-haul aircraft, mainly VIP/government use; one configured as Kim Jong Un’s personal plane
- **1 Tupolev Tu-154B** – used on services to Vladivostok
- **1 Tupolev Tu-204-100B** – main international aircraft
- **1 Tupolev Tu-204-300** – configured for international services

In addition, Air Koryo retains older types such as the Il-18, Tu-134, An-24, and Il-76 cargo aircraft, many of which are rarely used or retired.

The Tu-204 fleet represents the airline’s most modern equipment and remains the [only type approved for EU operations](https://web.archive.org/web/20121117224638/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban/doc/list_en.pdf).

## Is Air Koryo the World’s Worst Airline?

Air Koryo often carries the infamous reputation of being the “world’s worst airline.” This label comes largely from Skytrax, an airline review website that once awarded Air Koryo a one-star rating. While Skytrax ratings are not official aviation safety assessments, the media and travel blogs quickly popularized the stigma. Today, Skytrax no longer ranks Air Koryo, instead listing it as “Airline not rated”. Interestingly, [reviews on the site](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/air-koryo/) from actual passengers average 6/10, which puts the airline above some budget carriers. 

The official [airline’s website](http://www.airkoryo.com.kp) is outdated and not fully responsive. As a result, tourists are unable to book Air Koryo flights directly online. Instead, tickets must be arranged through an authorized [travel agent or a registered tour operator](https://koryogroup.com/travel-guide/air-koryo-north-korea-travel-guide).

## What It’s Like to Fly with Air Koryo?

For aviation enthusiasts, flying with Air Koryo is a unique experience. International flights generally use the airline’s most modern jets, such as the Tupolev Tu-204, while domestic flights may still use older Soviet-era aircraft like the Ilyushin Il-18 or Tu-134. These planes offer unusually generous legroom compared to modern budget carriers, and for many passengers, the novelty of flying such rare aircraft is part of the appeal.

Cabin crew are known for their neat uniforms and formal service style. While English may not always be fluent, travelers often remark on their politeness and presentation.

The most famous part of the Air Koryo experience is the in-flight meal: the so-called “mystery burger.” This simple sandwich with a pork patty has [gained a cult following online](https://streetfoodguy.com/air-koryo-food-drink/), more for its quirky reputation than its taste. Vegetarian alternatives are available but equally basic.
