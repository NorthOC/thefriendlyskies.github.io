The [Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II](https://thefriendlyskies.net/article/difference-between-f22-f35/) is a cutting-edge fifth-generation multi-role stealth fighter aircraft, specifically developed to meet the evolving demands of modern air warfare. With its advanced technology and versatility, the F-35 has become a key asset for numerous air forces around the world.

Let’s look at its origin, design, performance, variants, price, operators and future development of this relatively new aircraft.

## History

The F-35 program can trace its roots back to the Joint Strike Fighter program that ran from 1980s to 90s. The goal was to develop a single, affordable and versatile aircraft platform that could replace a multitude of aging fighter aircraft across various military operators. In 2001, [Lockheed Martin won the contract ](https://web.archive.org/web/20190706050004/http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_f35.htm)for the development and production of the F-35. 

Therefore, the first flight of the F-35 Lightning II took place on December 15, 2006, when the first F-35A variant was introduced to the public.

## Specifications of F-35 variants

The F-35 program includes four primary variants, each tailored to the specific needs of different military branches:

- **F-35A conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL)**: Designed to operate from conventional runways, was introduced to the U.S. Air Force (USAF) on August 2, 2016.
- **F-35B short take-off and vertical-landing (STOVL)**: Capable of operating from short runways and amphibious assault ships. Introduced to the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) on July 31, 2015.
- **F-35C carrier-based (CV/CATOBAR)**: The carrier-based variant, optimized for catapult launches and arrested landings on aircraft carriers. Introduced to the U.S. Navy (USN)  on February 28, 2019.
- **F-35I Adir F-35A with Israeli modifications**: Introduced to the Israeli Air Force on June 22, 2016.

## F-35: designed for multirole operations

The F-35 was designed to excel in several key mission areas, including air-to-air combat, air-to-ground strikes, electronic warfare (EW), intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and close air support. Its mission versatility is achieved through its ability to carry a wide range of weapons, advanced sensors and stealth capabilities, allowing it to operate in highly contested environments.

## Stealthy and modern design

The F-35 features a modern, stealthy design that reduces its radar cross-section and infrared signature. This makes it difficult for enemy radar systems to detect and track, giving it a significant [advantage in terms of survivability](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-explain-the-components-of-the-stealth-technology-used-in-an-F-35-and-how-it-affects-its-radar-signature) during air-to-air and ground-to-air engagements. The aircraft incorporates a delta-wing design for enhanced maneuverability and stability.

## F-35 Lightning II: performance facts

- The F-35 can reach a speed of 1,228 mph (1,960 km/h) or Mach 1.6 and operate at altitudes exceeding 50,000 ft.
- Its combat radius varies between variants, with the F-35C having the longest range of 670 nm (1,241 km).
- The aircraft is equipped with a single Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-100 turbofan engine, which delivers 28,000 lbf (125 kN) of thrust without afterburner and 43,000 lbf (191 kN) with it.
- The aircraft can carry a mix of air-to-air and air-to-ground artillery both internally and externally.
- Advanced sensors, including the AN/APG-81 AESA radar and Distributed Aperture System, provide unparalleled situational awareness.

## Most expensive weapon program in history

The F-35 is the [most expensive weapons system ever](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/f-35-most-expensive/), with a price tag of between $150-200 million per unit. 

However, it's important to note that the [price varies](https://time.com/7269375/trump-nato-europe-canada-fighter-jets-defense-technology-made-america/) depending on factors such as quantity, customization and production efficiencies.

## Current operators of F-35 and deliveries

The aircraft is currently in active service with various air forces and navies around the world. Its operators include the United States (USAF, USMC, USN), the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Norway, South Korea, Japan, Israel and Australia. Also, At least nine countries have placed orders for the F-35 in the near future. As of 2025, the number of units built had [exceeded 1,100 aircraft](https://www.f35.com/f35/about/fast-facts.html). 

## Future development 

F-35s software was developed as six releases, or Blocks, for System Development and Demonstration (SDD). Block 3F marks the final build of the SDD phase, shifting attention to the next major upgrade: Block 4, starting development in 2019. The goal of Block 4 is to integrate a series of enhancements, including additional weapons, improved sensors, and EW capabilities. It is entering service in incremental steps, starting in the late 2020s and continuing into the [early 2030s](https://euro-sd.com/2024/07/major-news/39170/f-35-the-future-or-trainwreck/).

Key improvements in Block 4 include the integration of the AN/APG-85 AESA radar, a new radar system designed to [offer superior performance](https://web.archive.org/web/20200731040956/https://www.defenseworld.net/news/24904/Lockheed_Martin_Awarded__1_8_Billion_for_F_35_Block_4_Development#.XyOZrOzP32c) in EW and target tracking. Additionally, Block 4 will expand the aircraft’s weapon capacity to include systems unique to international customers, and it will incorporate improvements to the aircraft's Electronic Support Measures bandwidth and the ability to use Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver support for enhanced communications.

One of the key enablers of Block 4 is the Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) avionics hardware. This upgrade includes new display systems, a more powerful core processor, and increased memory modules, all designed to support the increased processing power required for the new mission systems. In addition to avionics updates, the TR-3 upgrade also includes an engine modification to support higher cooling capacity, which is necessary for the new, more demanding systems.
